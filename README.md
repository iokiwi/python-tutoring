## Installing Python

https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Accessing Python

 * IDLE (Interactive Development Learning Evironment) [Easiest]
 * Text Editor
    * Visual Studio Code (recommended - best allround)
    * Atom (simple, extensible)
 * IDE pycharm (Most features - often over the top for python)
 * cmd (command line)

## Finding Help

Your best bet is to google and look for search results which come from these pages.

 * Python documentation https://docs.python.org/3/
 * Stack Overflow https://stackoverflow.com/

Be careful with results from 'tutorialspoint', 'w3schools' as they can sometimes give incomplete or incorrect advice.

Answers on Stack Overflow can also be incomplete or incorrect but due to users being able to upvote and downvote and comment on answers, it's often apparent if the answer is good or bad?
